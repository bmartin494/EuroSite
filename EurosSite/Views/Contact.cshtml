        <h2>Accomodation</h2>
            <p>
                There are a range of accommodation options around Ballyholme and in the town of Bangor. There is an excellent selection of B&Bs all along the Seacliff Road (the one that runs along the coast from the town centre to Ballyholme YC), and further round in to the town itself. 
                There are several hotels nearby too, Including the Marine Court Hotel and the newly constructed Premier Inn beside Bangor Castle.
